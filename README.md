# TankShooter
Simple top-down tank shooter made with Love2D (lua)
Making a simple game for the sake of improving my game development skills, and attempting to release a game on itch.io (despite how bad..)

Things I plan to do
* Entity-Component-System
* Effects (lightng, explosions)
* AI
* Path-finding

If super-motivated, I might add
* Networking
* Multiple levels
* More serious artwork
